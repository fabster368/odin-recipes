<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This Vegan Lasagna Recipe is the absolute best, and it’s also a delicious high-protein pasta dinner! It’s such an ultimate cheesy comfort food dish that’s perfect for both the holidays and regular weeknights!</p>
<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Noodles </li> <p>Obviously you’ll need some lasagna noodles for layering! (See tips section below for a quick note on this.) You can get no boil, standard, gluten free or even freshly made.</p> 
  <li> Olive Oil </li> <p>For sautéing the onion and eggplant cubes. </p>
  <li> Onion </li> <p> I used a white onion for this lasagna, diced.</p>
  <li> Garlic </li>  <p> For extra flavor, minced.</p>
  <li> Eggplant</li> <p> You’ll need to evenly cut and cube it before starting.</p>
  <li> Seasoning </li> <p> Add a little sea salt, and a little ground black pepper.</p>
  <li> Vegan Meat Alternative Crumbles</li> <p> I used Beyond Meat crumbles for this recipe.</p>
  <li> Tomato Sauce </li> <p> Tomato Sauce: You can use whatever brand of marinara sauce that you like.</p>
  <li> Vegan Ricotta </li>  <p> I made my own vegan ricotta, and if you want to I 100% recommend this one, but definitely buy some if you can because it’s quick and easy, and it tastes great.</p>
  <li> Shredded Vegan Mozzarella </li> <p>I recommend Nurishh Mozzarella Style Shreds, Miyokos vegan mozzarella, Follow Your Heart or Daiya shreds.</p>
  <li> Basil </li>  <p>Optional. (This is for a garnish.)</p>
</ul>
